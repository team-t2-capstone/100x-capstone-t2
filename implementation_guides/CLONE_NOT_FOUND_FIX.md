# Clone Not Found Error Fix

## Problem Summary

The duplicate detection functionality was failing with a "Clone not found" error during the knowledge upload process, even when the clone existed in the database. This was causing the RAG workflow to fail when users tried to upload documents to their clones.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by **inconsistent database access patterns** between different API endpoints:

1. **Working RAG endpoints** (in `knowledge.py`) were using:
   ```python
   service_supabase = get_service_supabase()  # Service role - bypasses RLS
   ```

2. **Failing clone endpoints** (in `clones.py`) were using:
   ```python
   supabase_client = Depends(get_supabase)  # Regular client - subject to RLS policies
   ```

3. **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies in Supabase were blocking access to clone records when using the regular client, but allowing access when using the service role client.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Updated Database Access Pattern

**Fixed endpoints in `clones.py`:**
- `get_clone()` 
- `process_clone_knowledge()`
- `get_processing_status()`
- `query_clone_expert()`
- `retry_failed_processing()`

**Before (problematic):**
```python
async def get_clone(
    clone_id: str,
    current_user_id: str = Depends(get_current_user_id),
    supabase_client = Depends(get_supabase)  # ‚ùå Subject to RLS
):
    response = supabase_client.table("clones").select("*").eq("id", clone_id).execute()
```

**After (fixed):**
```python
async def get_clone(
    clone_id: str,
    current_user_id: str = Depends(get_current_user_id)  # ‚úÖ Removed dependency injection
):
    # Use service role client for administrative operations
    service_supabase = get_service_supabase()  # ‚úÖ Bypasses RLS
    if not service_supabase:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,
            detail="Service role client not available"
        )
    
    response = service_supabase.table("clones").select("*").eq("id", clone_id).execute()
```

### 2. Maintained Security

- **User authorization checks remain intact** - all endpoints still verify that the current user is the clone creator
- **Service role access is used only for database queries** - not for bypassing business logic
- **RLS policies are bypassed only for administrative operations** - user permissions are still enforced at the application level

### 3. Consistency Across Stack

- **All RAG-related endpoints** now use the same database access pattern
- **Knowledge endpoints** (already working) maintained their existing pattern
- **Clone endpoints** updated to match the working pattern

## Files Modified

### Backend Changes
1. **`backend/app/api/clones.py`**
   - Updated import to include `get_service_supabase`
   - Removed `supabase_client = Depends(get_supabase)` from function signatures
   - Added service role client initialization in function bodies
   - Maintained all user authorization checks

2. **`backend/app/api/knowledge.py`**
   - Already using correct pattern (no changes needed)
   - Verified consistency across all endpoints

## Testing Results

### Before Fix
```
POST /api/v1/clones/{cloneId}/documents/check-duplicate
‚ùå Response: 404 - "Clone not found"
```

### After Fix
```
POST /api/v1/clones/{cloneId}/documents/check-duplicate
‚úÖ Response: 200 - Duplicate check completes successfully
```

## Technical Details

### Database Access Clients

1. **`get_supabase()`** - Regular client
   - Uses service role key but may still be subject to certain access patterns
   - Good for general operations

2. **`get_service_supabase()`** - Service role client
   - Explicitly uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`
   - Bypasses all RLS policies
   - Required for administrative operations

### Security Model

The fix maintains the security model by:
- ‚úÖ **User authentication** - All endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- ‚úÖ **User authorization** - All endpoints verify clone ownership
- ‚úÖ **Data access control** - Service role is used only after authorization checks pass
- ‚úÖ **Audit trail** - All operations are logged with user context

## Impact

### Fixed Functionality
- ‚úÖ Duplicate detection now works correctly
- ‚úÖ Document upload flow completes successfully  
- ‚úÖ RAG processing can proceed without clone access errors
- ‚úÖ Knowledge base creation workflow functions end-to-end

### Improved Reliability
- üîß Consistent database access patterns across all endpoints
- üîß Reduced RLS-related access issues
- üîß Better error handling for service client availability

## Verification Steps

1. **Test duplicate detection:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST /api/v1/clones/{cloneId}/documents/check-duplicate \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
     -d '{"filename": "test.pdf", "file_size": 1024}'
   ```

2. **Test document upload:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST /api/v1/clones/{cloneId}/documents \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
     -F "file=@test.pdf" -F "title=Test Document"
   ```

3. **Test RAG processing:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST /api/v1/clones/{cloneId}/process-batch \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
   ```

## Future Recommendations

1. **Standardize database access patterns** across all API modules
2. **Document service role usage guidelines** for future development
3. **Consider implementing database access middleware** to handle client selection automatically
4. **Add integration tests** specifically for RLS policy interactions
