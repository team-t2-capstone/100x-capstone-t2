Machine Learning Best Practices

This document contains essential information about machine learning best practices for AI development.

Data Preparation:
- Clean and preprocess your data thoroughly
- Handle missing values appropriately
- Scale features when necessary
- Split data into training, validation, and test sets

Model Selection:
- Start with simple models and gradually increase complexity
- Use cross-validation to evaluate model performance
- Consider ensemble methods for better predictions
- Choose appropriate metrics for your problem type

Feature Engineering:
- Create meaningful features from raw data
- Use domain knowledge to guide feature creation
- Remove irrelevant or redundant features
- Apply feature scaling and normalization

Model Training:
- Use regularization to prevent overfitting
- Monitor training and validation loss
- Implement early stopping when appropriate
- Save model checkpoints during training

Evaluation and Testing:
- Test on unseen data to assess real-world performance
- Use appropriate evaluation metrics for your task
- Analyze model errors and failure cases
- Consider bias and fairness in model predictions

Deployment:
- Monitor model performance in production
- Implement proper versioning and rollback procedures
- Set up alerts for performance degradation
- Plan for model retraining and updates

This knowledge will help create better AI systems that are robust, reliable, and ethical.
